8801,200K + MANAGEMENT POSITION FOR EXPERIENCED MERCHANT CASH ADVANCE REPS,"ONLY ONE MANAGER POSITION PER CITY/REGION IS OPEN RIGHT NOW! WORKED FROM HOME BY PHONE OR IN PERSON LOCALLY – YOUR CHOICE! OVER 40 MAJOR CITIES STILL AVAILABLE! YOU WILL EARN 40% OF THE GROSS PROFIT ON YOUR TEAMS FUNDED DEALS! YOU WILL EARN 40% OF THE GROSS PROFITS FROM YOUR TEAMS RENEWALS AND STACKS! YOU WILL EARN 10% OF THE CLIENT EQUITY IN YOUR TEAMS CLIENT BASE! PLUS: YOU WILL EARN 60% OF FUNDED AMOUNT COMMISSIONS ON YOUR OWN DEALS YOU WILL EARN 50% OF ALL EXTRA FEES CHARGED ON YOUR OWN DEALS YOU WILL EARN 50% OF THE CLIENT EQUITY IN YOUR OWN CLIENT BASE! If you are working in the merchant cash advance/small business funding industry and want to create your own team of reps who can also have the ability to recruit their own reps in to your team, and you want to get paid from all of their efforts, then read this ad carefully. Our company has preferred relationships with over 30 different private funding sources and we have a great reputation. Our name is not in this ad to prevent us from showing up in Google indexing under our company name, which would then let our existing and potential clients know how much commission we all make. What a disaster that would be. Wouldn't you agree? But once we give you our name and you check us out you will see that we are the real deal. We have management positions available to a limited number of individuals that are hungry to build a six figure income and client base in the small business funding industry. We will only take on one manager to cover one geographic area (city or state or region; depending upon population density), and that manager will have the right to recruit within your assigned territory and can have their team get deals funded from all over the country. The best part is that this can all be done over the phone, if you qualify. Your manager's agreement allows you to build your own sales team of reps for our company, and to get paid 40% of the gross profit on each of their funded deals. Gross profit for our Agreement is the amount left over after the contracted reps on your team are paid their commissions. Your recruited reps earn either 3%, 5% or 6% on the funded amount of their deals (depending upon the repayment term), plus they earn 50% of any extra fees charged by our company. An Example would be, if the deal is a good $50,000 first position with a restaurant or trucking company or some industry that is inside the box for our type of business, then we can now get up to 12% of the funded amount (or more in some cases), as a top sell rate commission from our funders. Plus we can charge fees on most first position deals of another 2% to 4% (first positions being deals where no other funding is in place). If we pay your rep 5% to 6% on a deal like that, plus 50% of the fees, then there is a lot of room left over for profit. On 50K at 12% plus 3% in fees if the rep got 5% commission on the funded amount and 1 and 1/2% in fee commissions ($3250 commission), there would be 7% + 1 and 1/2% left in gross profit for our company and the manager to split 60/40. So $4250 gross profit on that deal = a $1700 override commission for you the manager. Imagine 20 or more of those overrides per month. Even on the subprime deals (2nd, 3rd positions, gas stations, sub 500 credit, 6 months in business, etc.) we can now get 6% to 8% of the funded amount, plus charge 3% to 12% in fees depending upon the deal. So on a real bad deal, worst case scenario, the reps gets 3%, Our company gets 3% on the funded as commission and our company and the rep split another 5% in fees. On a 50K subprime deal, that would equal $2750 in gross profit for our company which is an $1100 override commission for you as the manager. Your manager’s agreement also prevents you from be circumvented by your reps. Once they sign up through you they are locked in to you as long as you remain with our company, and you even get paid residuals up to 2 years after your last active date with us, if you ever left. This opportunity is for a limited time, and even though there is no set quota, if some decent level of performance is not met then the opportunity would be revoked after 30 to 60 days. We also would provide you with an ad to run in your designated city and would re-reimburse you with override commissions paid,  We would also provide you and your recruited reps with a company e-mail and all of your recruiting must be done through that e-mail. We have a very unique way of selling these business funding products and it is working for our reps in a big way. We will provide you with scripts and materials that you can give your reps, but ultimately it will be up to you to: A. Recruit Them (using our ad or your own, and by using your contacts locally) B. Train Them (using our scripts combined with your experience and industry knowledge) C. Manage Them (keep them motivated, answer questions and act as their liaison with our company) If you do these 3 things, and keep doing it, then you will build a six figure income from this business. If you do these things well you can build a huge income and a book of business that you can cash out on in the future should we sell or go public; which is why we are in this business, besides the great profit margins. This is a very lucrative opportunity for the right person. If you are not experienced in this business then do not reply to this ad. If you are a rep sitting in someone else's business making 3% or 4% of the funded amount of your deals (or less), with little or no residuals and no client equity, and want a chance to build your own team and get paid leveraged income and residual income from the efforts of others, then we welcome you to apply. We will only give this position to one person to cover any one city, even though you and your team can get deals from all over the country, you can only recruit reps on CL in your designated area. But you may recruit offline wherever you want. So when you apply be convincing enough for us to call you back. Again, ""NO EXPERIENCE IN THE MCA INDUSTRY"", ""NO POSITION"". . .  ",Unknown,,"Our name is not in this ad to prevent us from showing up in Google indexing under our company name, which would then let our existing and potential clients know how much commission we all make.

In addition, ServiceTitan helps its customers grow their revenue through an incredible set of Mobile, I-Pad based field sales tools and the unique ability to automatically track/manage online and offline marketing campaigns.  See #URL_c377232ba798621a91b519780bd9e55951540767b8f311ae482a1f5b1a8f3b9c# for more information.At ServiceTitan you will have the opportunity to work at one of LA’s most interesting SaaS start-ups—a rapidly growing, already profitable company led by two co-founders under 30 years of age who grew up in the trades their father’s pursued (plumbing and contracting respectively) and vowed to use their education in programming and innate skill to make a product (7 years later) that their own parents desperately needed to become more successful running their own small businesses. This is a unique opportunity to be part of a successful startup with a B2B product depended upon by customers around the country, yet still early enough in its headcount (currently 20 strong!) to offer its employees significant growth and leadership opportunities. Reporting to the Chief Marketing Officer, the Marketing Communications Coordinator will be the first hire within the marketing team, charged with informing potential customers, the media, and everyone that will listen about the great things that we’re doing at ServiceTitan!About the JobService Titan needs a Marketing Communications Coordinator with 2-3 years of PR/MarComm experience (agency or client-side) ready to hit the ground running. This position will evolve and expand over time as the company grows – but to start it will be about 70% PR (Media and Blogger Outreach, Content Marketing) and Social Media Management, and 30% creation of marketing materials to support sales, coordinate trade shows, and maximize speaking engagements and guest blog posts for the CEO. Ideal candidate must be able to write well, be interested in technology, and want to work full-time on-site in our Glendale office. Here’s what you should be comfortable with:Research: reading, social media, homework about the space and our competitors, etc.  Media (Journalists and Bloggers): reading their stuff, outreach, getting to KNOW them, making their lives easier, knowing what makes them tickWriting Press Releases: learn the basics, and how to pitch anything to anyoneCreating marketing collateral (with the help of a designer)While this seems like a lot, we balance ourselves with a healthy dose of reality and we know we’re not driving ambulances here.

Farmers Business Network gathers disparate data from its farmer Members, analyzes the data, and converts it into new insights and perspectives, previously unavailable, that can help farmers make better decisions, manage risk, and ultimately increase the profitability of their farming operations.  We're seeking a full-time, Ohio based Field Operations Specialist. Field Operations Specialists are the front-line of our company, bringing our vision and services to farmers and ensuring they have a stellar experience with FBN. This job will cover a region within about a 120 mile radius of Columbus, OH.  Some travel will be required within that geography. The applicant should live in or within reasonable proximity to Columbus, OH..",Unknown,,"Working at FBNAt FBN, we put farmers first. For every decision we make, we consider its impact on farmers big and small. Only after this has been considered will we consider the impact of our decisions on FBN, followed by our fellow team members, and finally ourselves. Before making a decision, we listen to farmers and learn about how implementing it will impact them.While making a decision or working on a project, we prefer working in small teams to make sure our employees feel empowered and own their decisions. Finally, after our decisions are made, we communicate those decisions to our farmers and to the rest of the team.FBN employees are a diverse group with a common passion for agriculture. We respect humility, value honesty, and despise entitlement. We see farmers as hackers and entrepreneurs, able to fix things with duct tape and baling wire while predicting the weather and analysing their financial position on the commodities market. Just like farmers, we believe that if something is broken, it’s better to fix it than to complain about it.All FBN employees, regardless of the position, will spend meaningful time visiting farms, to meet with some of our founding and network farmers in order to discuss their equipment and data collection practices.As a Silicon Valley based company with a Midwestern culture, we believe in the power of getting things done, and understand that creativity is fostered by trust and the ability to focus. As a result, meetings are avoided and we respect everyone’s right to at least one day a week without meetings. Thursdays are considered “no meeting days.”Finally, there are no shrinking violets here. The team consists of many people with deep experience in agriculture, technology, data science, machine learning, physics among other areas. So be prepared to offer opinions!Interviewing at FBNOur interview panels are as diverse as our employees. You may be expected to interview with an agronomist, a physicist, a data scientist, and because of our strong focus on farmers, we expect every FBN candidate to interview with one of our founding farmers, advisory board members or network members. As a result, our interviews will take you out of your comfort zone. Be prepared to be asked to solve hard problems that may seem daunting, to be asked questions that will test your curiosity, and to meet really awesome people.If FBN sounds like a place where you would like to work and if you're excited about making a difference in the lives of thousands of farmers, take a look at our current openings.",0.0,"US, OH, Columbus",0

The Production Art Department is responsible for getting customer-submitted artwork ready for various forms of printing.First, we'd like to provide a brief history lesson on the technologies that we use:In 1988, a cabal of ancient wizards known collectively as ADOBE bestowed upon the world a magical text called ‘The Photographyshoppe, vol. 1’ (often modernized as ‘Photoshop’). This creation granted even the non-magical among us some measure of reality-warping capabilities, and the world has not been the same since. As the renown of ADOBE grows, so too does the power of their most lauded creation.Our customers are wonderful, creative people, but they can sometimes use a helping hand on the graphic design end of things. Your job will be to tap into the reservoir of ADOBE's magic and use it to make our customers' designs look perfect. You’ll need to possess a keen attention to detail, because the magic of the Photographyshoppe does have limits. (Not to mention that reciting the wrong incantation can have disastrous consequences.)You’ll also work closely with our Customer Service and Production departments to help ensure the finished product is exactly what the customer has envisioned, so excellent communication skills are required. The other departments are primarily working with technology that is not derived from ancient magic, so speaking in cryptic riddles and magical spells is generally frowned upon.Previous knowledge of the print industry is definitely helpful, but is not required. We can bring you up to speed on that.We do our best to ensure a fun, energetic workplace, and we look forward to seeing what you can add to that.",Unknown,,"#URL_25e85371e7108e279a4b25d6e965889a44917879b7b587c905714ef30f933cb8# is a young, growing e-commerce company with our eyes on the future.  Ever since our launch in 2005, we've been growing year after year.  Homegrown in Athens, GA, UberPrints runs its customer service and production operations just behind downtown.  We're now looking to expand our reach by opening an Atlanta office to house our business development, IT, and creative teams. ",0.0,"US, , Athens",0

Our team is behind a #1 game on Facebook, two #2 games on facebook, and one of the biggest virtual worlds for kids on the planet. And now with Samurai Siege we have a US top 50 grossing app (top 10 in some countries) played by more than 7m people in it’s first few months since launch.We love great tech. Not for its own sake but because we make games for big audiences and that means it’s got to work all the time. Because we are in a competitive space and that means we need to be fast and efficient. We are serious about sprint management. It’s good for our game, and keeps us focused.We are a creative company tempered by great analytics. Smart analytics can make a good game even better. But we think analytics alone makes soulless products.

Cool!” And then, if you’re really experienced, you’re probably thinking, “Oh, wow...that sounds like a lot of responsibility!” And you’d be right.

Farmer Experience Managers are the front-line of our company, bringing our product and vision to farmers and ensuring they have a stellar experience with FBN. This job will cover a territory covering a region in the eastern/central part of South Dakota, Southwest MN, and portions of IA and NE within reasonable proximity to Sioux Falls.",Unknown,,"Working at FBNAt FBN, we put farmers first. For every decision we make, we consider its impact on farmers big and small. Only after this has been considered will we consider the impact of our decisions on FBN, followed by our fellow team members, and finally ourselves. Before making a decision, we listen to farmers and learn about how implementing it will impact them.While making a decision or working on a project, we prefer working in small teams to make sure our employees feel empowered and own their decisions. Finally, after our decisions are made, we communicate those decisions to our farmers and to the rest of the team.FBN employees are a diverse group with a common passion for agriculture. We respect humility, value honesty, and despise entitlement. We see farmers as hackers and entrepreneurs, able to fix things with duct tape and baling wire while predicting the weather and analysing their financial position on the commodities market. Just like farmers, we believe that if something is broken, it’s better to fix it than to complain about it.All FBN employees, regardless of the position, will spend meaningful time visiting farms, to meet with some of our founding and network farmers in order to discuss their equipment and data collection practices.As a Silicon Valley based company with a Midwestern culture, we believe in the power of getting things done, and understand that creativity is fostered by trust and the ability to focus. As a result, meetings are avoided and we respect everyone’s right to at least one day a week without meetings. Thursdays are considered “no meeting days.”Finally, there are no shrinking violets here. The team consists of many people with deep experience in agriculture, technology, data science, machine learning, physics among other areas. So be prepared to offer opinions!Interviewing at FBNOur interview panels are as diverse as our employees. You may be expected to interview with an agronomist, a physicist, a data scientist, and because of our strong focus on farmers, we expect every FBN candidate to interview with one of our founding farmers, advisory board members or network members. As a result, our interviews will take you out of your comfort zone. Be prepared to be asked to solve hard problems that may seem daunting, to be asked questions that will test your curiosity, and to meet really awesome people.If FBN sounds like a place where you would like to work and if you're excited about making a difference in the lives of thousands of farmers, take a look at our current openings.",0.0,"US, SD, Sioux Falls",0

For every decision we make, we consider its impact on farmers big and small.

Before making a decision, we listen to farmers and learn about how implementing it will impact them.While making a decision or working on a project, we prefer working in small teams to make sure our employees feel empowered and own their decisions. Finally, after our decisions are made, we communicate those decisions to our farmers and to the rest of the team.FBN employees are a diverse group with a common passion for agriculture. We respect humility, value honesty, and despise entitlement. We see farmers as hackers and entrepreneurs, able to fix things with duct tape and baling wire while predicting the weather and analysing their financial position on the commodities market. Just like farmers, we believe that if something is broken, it’s better to fix it than to complain about it.All FBN employees, regardless of the position, will spend meaningful time visiting farms, to meet with some of our founding and network farmers in order to discuss their equipment and data collection practices.As a Silicon Valley based company with a Midwestern culture, we believe in the power of getting things done, and understand that creativity is fostered by trust and the ability to focus. As a result, meetings are avoided and we respect everyone’s right to at least one day a week without meetings. Thursdays are considered “no meeting days.”Finally, there are no shrinking violets here. The team consists of many people with deep experience in agriculture, technology, data science, machine learning, physics among other areas. So be prepared to offer opinions!Interviewing at FBNOur interview panels are as diverse as our employees. You may be expected to interview with an agronomist, a physicist, a data scientist, and because of our strong focus on farmers, we expect every FBN candidate to interview with one of our founding farmers, advisory board members or network members. As a result, our interviews will take you out of your comfort zone. Be prepared to be asked to solve hard problems that may seem daunting, to be asked questions that will test your curiosity, and to meet really awesome people.If FBN sounds like a place where you would like to work and if you're excited about making a difference in the lives of thousands of farmers, take a look at our current openings.",0.0,"US, CA, San Carlos",0

The applicant should live in or near Lansing, MI.",Unknown,,"Working at FBNAt FBN, we put farmers first. For every decision we make, we consider its impact on farmers big and small. Only after this has been considered will we consider the impact of our decisions on FBN, followed by our fellow team members, and finally ourselves. Before making a decision, we listen to farmers and learn about how implementing it will impact them.While making a decision or working on a project, we prefer working in small teams to make sure our employees feel empowered and own their decisions. Finally, after our decisions are made, we communicate those decisions to our farmers and to the rest of the team.FBN employees are a diverse group with a common passion for agriculture. We respect humility, value honesty, and despise entitlement. We see farmers as hackers and entrepreneurs, able to fix things with duct tape and baling wire while predicting the weather and analysing their financial position on the commodities market. Just like farmers, we believe that if something is broken, it’s better to fix it than to complain about it.All FBN employees, regardless of the position, will spend meaningful time visiting farms, to meet with some of our founding and network farmers in order to discuss their equipment and data collection practices.As a Silicon Valley based company with a Midwestern culture, we believe in the power of getting things done, and understand that creativity is fostered by trust and the ability to focus. As a result, meetings are avoided and we respect everyone’s right to at least one day a week without meetings. Thursdays are considered “no meeting days.”Finally, there are no shrinking violets here. The team consists of many people with deep experience in agriculture, technology, data science, machine learning, physics among other areas. So be prepared to offer opinions!Interviewing at FBNOur interview panels are as diverse as our employees. You may be expected to interview with an agronomist, a physicist, a data scientist, and because of our strong focus on farmers, we expect every FBN candidate to interview with one of our founding farmers, advisory board members or network members. As a result, our interviews will take you out of your comfort zone. Be prepared to be asked to solve hard problems that may seem daunting, to be asked questions that will test your curiosity, and to meet really awesome people.If FBN sounds like a place where you would like to work and if you're excited about making a difference in the lives of thousands of farmers, take a look at our current openings.",0.0,"US, MI, Lansing",0

We see farmers as hackers and entrepreneurs, able to fix things with duct tape and baling wire while predicting the weather and analysing their financial position on the commodities market. Just like farmers, we believe that if something is broken, it’s better to fix it than to complain about it.All FBN employees, regardless of the position, will spend meaningful time visiting farms, to meet with some of our founding and network farmers in order to discuss their equipment and data collection practices.As a Silicon Valley based company with a Midwestern culture, we believe in the power of getting things done, and understand that creativity is fostered by trust and the ability to focus. As a result, meetings are avoided and we respect everyone’s right to at least one day a week without meetings. Thursdays are considered “no meeting days.”Finally, there are no shrinking violets here. The team consists of many people with deep experience in agriculture, technology, data science, machine learning, physics among other areas. So be prepared to offer opinions!Interviewing at FBNOur interview panels are as diverse as our employees. You may be expected to interview with an agronomist, a physicist, a data scientist, and because of our strong focus on farmers, we expect every FBN candidate to interview with one of our founding farmers, advisory board members or network members. As a result, our interviews will take you out of your comfort zone. Be prepared to be asked to solve hard problems that may seem daunting, to be asked questions that will test your curiosity, and to meet really awesome people.If FBN sounds like a place where you would like to work and if you're excited about making a difference in the lives of thousands of farmers, take a look at our current openings.",0.0,"US, SD, Yankton",0

We're comprised of a small founding team and achieved profitability within 3 months - a good sign for things to come.  We did not go to Stanford (but it's okay if you did) - rather we bootstrapped and hustled to profitability. We have raised a small advisory round to grow, continue to test markets, and recruit another developer (you.)  As an engineer with GoRefi, you'll work side-by-side with our CTO as a full stack Rails developer, and the right candidate will be an influential member of our organization moving forward. We’re looking for hackers with a strong CS background. Domain expertise in home lending is not required.",Unknown,,"GoRefi is building a platform for automating the front-end mortgage origination process, an annual $1.8T vertical that ultimately touches the lives of over 70 million Americans.The Right Candidate Will Relate To The Following:Find BalanceWe work a lot. Sometimes we sleep in the office. Sometimes we chat with clients at 3am. Sometimes we don't sleep at all. We work on weekends. We're hustlers and thrive on the craziness. But, we all have balanced lives outside of work and prioritize those things that are important to us. Family, friends, nights out, music, and the abundant nature that exists outside of our beautiful city - we play just as hard as we work.Defend or DieAt GoRefi, we're insanely passionate about fixing our broken industry. Transparency with our clients is paramount so it's only natural that our work environment embody the same openness. With so many ideas and only so much bandwidth to execute, open communication is key. We're small, lean, and nimble so your opinion is expected and respected. But, when you present an idea, be ready to defend it - because we question everything. It's this type of collaboration that helps us decide what to focus our energies on next.Strive for PerfectionWe fail every day, and it's awesome, because it means we're getting closer. There's a push to get our features out there and it's often a sacrifice to hit those deadlines, but given the sensitive nature of what GoRefi does, putting features out just for the sake of putting features out doesn't fly. We prefer to take a bit of extra time to do it right, even though we're moving at light speed compared to our competitors.Don't be a ""Larry""No offense if your name is Larry, of course. In this example, Larry's the typical used-car salesman selling you rust protection when you live in California or the fly-by-night mortgage broker charging you exorbitant fees and putting you in the wrong loan. This lie-cheat-steal crap is all over the web and in case you couldn't tell already - we're sick of it. A Larry is enticed by quotas - not service - and is compensated without justification of hours worked or exceptional performance. They sell for themselves and for their wallet, with a short-term vision that hurts everyone in their lives, especially their customers. At GoRefi, we don't have a Sales Department - we only have Support. Our clients get what's best for them and only them. Our motive is and always will be to ensure that our clients are happy with their experience.",0.0,"US, CA, San Francisco",0
